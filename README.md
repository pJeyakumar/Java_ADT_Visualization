# Java ADT and Sorting Algorithms Visualization

This project creates and graphically displays Java ADT structures such as: Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues and Binary Trees. Additonally, the project graphically displays common sorting algorithms such as: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort and Shell Sort.

**My App Class**

The main display, here the user can choose which ADT structure they'd like to construct or which sorting algorithm they'd like to perform.

_ADT Structure Chosen_

If an ADT structure is chosen, the user will be taken to a new interface, where they can add/delete the building blocks of the specified structure.

_Sorting Algorithm Chosen_

If a sorting algorithm is chosen, the user will be taken to a new interface with a set of bars with randomly chosen lengths. They can then step through the specified sorting algorithm, with the exception of some sorting algorithms.
